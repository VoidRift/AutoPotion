# AutoPotion

Auto Potion is a mod which gives a player the ability to automatically consume potions and foods which are located in certain inventories.
While auto potion is enabled it consumes the potions inside the defined inventory and once the duration of a potion runs out it automatically drinks the potion again.

The mod configurations has the following options.

The inventories are: 
* Player Inventory
* Bank
* Safe
* Defender's Forge
* Void Vault

There are also multiple config options for this mod like:
* Infinite potions ***This can be allowed/disallowed by the server***
* Use last potion
* Disable on death ***This can be allowed/disallowed by the server***
* Whitelist Mode
* Print empty potions & print color
* Increase the maximum number of available buffs (default in Terraria is 22 or 44 as of 1.4.4) ***This is a server only option. Works on Single-player as well***

There are also 2 keybind options.
* ```Toggle auto potion``` which enables or disables the auto potion consumption
* ```Single use potion``` which is similar to the default Terraria keybind ```B``` which consumes all potions which are located in the defined inventory
