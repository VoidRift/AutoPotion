Auto Potion is a mod which gives a player the ability to automatically consume potions and foods which are located in certain inventories.
Which can be defined by the user in the mods configurations.

The inventories are: 
* Player Inventory
* Bank
* Safe
* Defender's Forge.

There are also multiple config options for this mod like:
* Infinite potions *This can be allowed/disallowed by the server*
* Use last potion
* Disable on death
* Print empty potions & print color
* Increase the maximum number of available buffs (default in terraria is 22) *This is a server only option. Works on Single-player aswell.*

There are also 2 keybind options.
* "Toggle auto potion" which enables or disables the auto potion consumption
* "Single use potion" which is similar to the default terraria keybind "B" which consumes all potions which are located in the defined inventory
